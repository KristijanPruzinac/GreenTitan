# GreenTitan simulator

This is software written in Processing (java) sketchbook that is used to develop the GreenTitan project software. The issue with programming microcontrollers is often that it is harder to test them, especially with projects like robotic lawnmowers. It is for this reason that I decided to make this simulator so I can test mower software before deploying it with ESP32.

Feel free to use this if it is helpful to you in any way.
