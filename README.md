# GreenTitan
 GreenTitan is an open-source lawnmower project started in early 2023.
 The goal of the project is to enable makers to 3D print their own lawnmower that navigates using RTK GPS technology in well under a 1000$, because the commercial mowers are way too expensive.

The project currently uses the C94-M8P RTK GPS development board by u-blox, available through online retailers such as Mouser and others. When buying the board make sure to buy the correct variant of the board according to your region (https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/c94-m8p).

# Competition
As the project is open-source there is not much competition for it except for other open source projects. Unfortunately other projects seem to either feature software for an already made machine or only the 3d printed case, not both. My goal is to provide both with documentation to enable anyone to make it themselves.
