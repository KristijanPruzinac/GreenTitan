Adjust minimum support area so supports are generated properly, but small holes aren't filled with supports (It is a pain to remove)

-----------------------------------------------------
ADVICE

Print every part so its interior side is facing the build plate, when supports are used on the exterior it looks pretty bad

The only parts I printed with exterior side facing build plate are the 2 back pieces and I printed their charging port facing the build plate, it looks tolerable
